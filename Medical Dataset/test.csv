MD-49997,555,"I came back from Cuba with a sinus infection about two weeks ago.. my doctor prescribed an antibiotic that I normally used in the past, long story short I got a very nasty case of Diarrhea after the 4th day.  Started going to the bathroom over 7 times a day (i literally lost count).. 
Went to the walk-in clinic again and they said that it could be due to C.difficile and asked me to do a stool test..  said i should book an appointment in 10 days when the results got back..   I waited two days and broke.. went back to them and said there is no point in waiting as all i did all day was go to the bathroom. Needless to say after one metronidazole pill it did the trick.

My dr added Benzepril on top of this and my blood pressure is still the same. Switching to a beta blocker next time I go to his office.

MD-50001,121,I was on this pill for 4 years. The side effects were pretty bad. I&#039;d get migraines. I&#039;d cry a lot. I became paranoid about things. Had severe anxiety. Was depressed a lot. Pretty much things that I never felt before until I got on this pill. Very effective in preventing pregnancy but would otherwise not recommend.,3,01-Aug-15
MD-50002,677,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! I get mild yeast infections every once in a while and it usually lasts a few days and goes away. Well I decided to try monistat 1. I inserted the ovule around 9pm and used the cream provided for just around the outside of my vagina and went to bed. I peed an hour later and went to lay down and I start to feel this intense burning pain. My vagina was swollen, red and the burning and itching was so painful and uncomfortable I couldn&#039;t sleep. I took a warm bath and then put ice on my vagina trying to ease the pain. finally after 2 hours got to a point where it wasn&#039;t completely unbearable but still burned. Today, 24 hrs later, it still is swollen, red and burns worse than the actual yeast infection. Waste of money!",1,18-Aug-16
MD-50003,408,"I have suffered from migraines for 32 years, the older I am the worse they become. I have both the Imitrex pills &amp; the shots.  When I am nauseated I must use the shot.  Approx. 1 minute after injection the intense buring in my head &amp; the amplified headache are the worst side effects however NOTHING compared to the migraine.  Usually the migraine is gone in 15 - 30 mins and I sleep it off. There is also the 12 - 24 hour Imitrex hangover from the shot.  Muscles feel as though they are made of jelly, overall wiped out feeling.  The pill does not have the burning effect for me and it takes the full 30 minutes to combat the migraine.  Imitrex is the only medicine which has worked for me consistantly over the years.  I become immune to all other  medicines.",9,19-Mar-12
MD-50004,579,"I have only used this once so I am not sure about ongoing side effects, but it is absolutely amazing stuff. It made my skin red-free and I felt like I was looking at my face for the first time. It lasted for the evening, then I washed it off. My skin became blotchy and stung a little bit, but this morning it is at its normal redness and not worse. I&#039;ve been trying cures/remedies for rosacea since I was 19 - I&#039;m so relieved right now, although a little bit wary because I still don&#039;t feel like something this good can be true. Looking forward to using it again today! ",10,29-Dec-14
MD-50005,58,"I&#039;ve been relapsing since I started drinking 10 years ago. I tried Campral, but didn&#039;t bother to take it as prescribed, often forgetting. After my 3rd rehab, and years of AA and counselling, this has been the most amazing medication I&#039;ve ever taken. I had zero hope it would work, given it didn&#039;t before (again, even tho I forgot to take it sometimes), but it has been a miracle. I mean a miracle. I can walk through the grocery store, see the liquor area, and not be have any desire to drink. I have a three particular triggers I cannot avoid, and have always relapsed due to them. However, I no longer feel the desire to drink now when experiencing them. I go to counselling and DBT, but nothing worked before. Do yourself a favor and try it.",10,04-May-17

MD-50007,295,"I was on the Pegasys for 48 weeks. I used the autoinjector and it was easy and painless. In fact after each injection I would look to make sure there was a spot of blood just to make sure I got it because I never felt it. It seems to have worked. I still have to do my 6 month check, but so far so good. Only negative effect was a small open wound that had turned into a very large wound that would not heal. I didn&#039;t know which of the 3 medicines from the therapy was to blame but the wound got larger almost overnight and would not heal. The wound care doctor seemed to think interferon was to blame and as soon as I was finished treatment he did a skin graft and got me on the way to healing that.",10,25-Aug-13

I have been lucky enough to experience no side effects (knock on wood), and I cannot wait to keep going and see what I can accomplish. It makes you get full faster and honestly makes you turn away from junk food.

MD-50012,83,"I had been on Zoloft for about a year or so which helped manage my anxiety, but didn&#039;t help when it came to a very stressful day or event that led to side effects like racing heart, labored breathing, sweating, stomach ulcers, etc. I needed something that I could take immediately to stave an anxiety attack off. My doctor prescribed Klonopin and I&#039;m so grateful for it. For me, it doesn&#039;t make me tired, lethargic, or dull me down. I was afraid of a medication that would just sedate me.

MD-50015,408,This medication is labeled a wonder drug in my household. It is the last line of defense and treatment for migraine. However and very sadly I might add recently the copay my insurance company imposed is going to make it hard to take. Limited to 4 tablets per week (while they state all medicines are calculated at a monthly dose level) NOW a copay of $60 per script makes it $240 for each myself and my wife. We just can&#039;t afford this after paying $2400.00 monthly for the insurance coverage. We are being choked to death! If the medicine was covered properly under the contract we could handle the $60 copay per month but because they limit the medication to 3-4 tablets per week. ,9,30-Jan-10

I suffered from migraines from childhood and first my doctor tried a blood pressure medicine that also treats migraines. While somewhat effective, I still had headaches and migraines after 1-2 months, up to 3-5 per week. Once he put me on Amitriptyline, all headaches are gone and I have had no recurrences of either regular headache or migraine. I no longer need pain medication and I feel like I have my life back.

MD-50023,418,Hi all. I am still on the fence on Lemtrada. I know there is no magic pill. It has slowed down the flares. My symptoms seem to have progressed. I guess it is fair to say maybe my expectations were too high?? It has been 7 months. I will update this if I see a shift. Very glad others had good experiences. Baby steps. Thanks,5,08-Aug-17
MD-50024,121,I have been on Kariva for 3 months and liked it pretty well. It definitely does its job with preventing pregnancy and also made my periods super light and short (4 days) which was nice. But I gained about 10 pounds on it which was awful! It did make my breasts fuller but the weight gain is terrible. No change in sex drive but it did cause some serious dryness for me in that I just wouldn&#039;t get wet down there which was frustrating for me and my bf! But overall not a bad price for a pill that does its job.,6,06-Aug-15
MD-50025,472,"Here is my Euflexxa story. 
I am 62 years old. I have always loved to play baseball. And now I play senior softball. And play in several tournaments a year.
I have played senior softball for seven years now. At first everything was ok with my knees. I was able to run and field my position. As an infielder I put a lot of stress and torque on my knee every game, every week.
But then 2014 I started having knee issues. The first time I had knee problems I walked around with a limp for 4 months. I went thought the usual knee remedies with the cortisone shots.
But after 2 years the cortisone shots stopped working. Then after a 3 day, 9 game tournament. My knee acted up again. I limped around for 4 to 5 months. 
Then my doctor recommended EUFLEXXA to me. I hesitated at first. Then I received the Euflexxa shots in early 2017. And I was able to play the entire Senior softball season, with very little pain. I played in tournaments every other weekend from May to October. I even played in a 3 day tournament that included 8 games. I did have minor soreness after each tournament, but that only lasted a couple of days.
I tell anyone who will listen about Euflexxa. And I know of several players have started checking into Euflexxa. In fact just received and answered an Email from an ex teammate about Euflexxa. And it was for his wife.
So, thank you for making Euflexxa and I will keep on telling everyone about it.",10,11-Oct-17

Told that it night take up to a week for it to work. Took 7.5 first night. Got 2 hrs sleep and during work, later that day felt weird. I already was going crazy from lack of sleep. Could not take another chance feeling that way at work from temazepam. I was given trazodone 8 month&#039;s earlier 50mg from doctor; I never used it. Was afraid I&#039;d be groggy. 
Did some research online, decided , out of desperation to try 50mg trazodone, with 7.5 temazepam, finally got some sleep, not 8 hrs but enough. I doubt this is recommended,I probably shouldn&#039;t take it together. Anyway taking combo 1, 2x a week. Don&#039;t want to become physically addicted. At least I get a few days of sleep.

I was still breaking out really bad, my skin was still oily. She put me on 60mg, with the 10mg my GP prescribed I thought the side effects were already terrible so being put on 60mg was a bit nerve wrecking. But its almost a month, yes the higher the dose the more terrible the side effects are. I am happy with the progress, my acne started in my early 20s, I&#039;m in my mid 20s now a few small pimples that are easily covered up by make up. My pre scars have improved A LOT.

MD-50031,121,"I am starting my third pack of this pill.  I am conflicted regarding it because it has reduced my anxiety and levelled my emotions wonderfully, but at the cost of having six day periods with only seven days of no period in between the next one.  I&#039;m having two periods a month and I&#039;m getting quite annoyed with having to buy tampons constantly.   The periods are not what I would consider breakthrough bleeding as they are not light and require extra absorbent tampons for the first few days.

I believe I have increased hunger and water retention on this pill as well.  I have gone from a stable 129lbs to 136lbs.

I am so happy with how level and calm I am on it...but fourteen days of bleeding a month is a steep price to pay for it.",5,"April 7, 2017"

I can have another erection within 15 minutes of ejaculating. If I take the pill Friday night after dinner, it works until at least Sunday night and sometimes Monday morning.

I only took Sprintec for two weeks and had to stop taking it. Here is a list of my bad experience:

-it made me sick to my stomach every single day
- after one week I had continuous breakthrough bleeding due to the low amount of progesterone in the pill
-my period are now irregular. Last month it was 4 days early, this month its 3 days (or more) late
- NOW I have found a bump in my breast, that hurts, and after having a cancer scare...I actually found out it&#039;s from the pill. The lack of pregesterone caused it.

I eat healthy, exercise regularly, and have had my thyroid and blood sugar checked, as well as blood tests for anemia, etc, all came back normal. The fatigue and lack of energy was what really bothered me and after doing my own research I discovered this can all be related to my BC. I&#039;m now trying a new pill.

At this point, my Dr. has put me on Junel Fe, which has been surprisingly a decent experience. At the beginning of the week I had what felt like minor period cramps but nothing unbearable, I felt very bloated after eating (which is abnormal for me), minor nausea but no vomiting, and even some urinary frequency.

They tried all doses and absolutely nothing changed. Not only that, I would miss a day and it was a nightmare. Eventually I cut myself off of it in the way the doctor told me to.

After reading everyone&#039;s reviews I think I was put on way too much. I weighed about 125 and I got down to 108! I thought I looked great although many people said I looked too skinny.

Yaz is a good switch from Trinessa if you&#039;re having problems. It&#039;s a lower dose of hormones with the same effectiveness. I can honestly say I feel like a better, happier person on Yaz.

Latuda was pretty good, no cognition-affecting side effects, but it did sometimes give me bouts of annoying nausea.

MD-50110,49,"I&rsquo;ve been on Loryna for a couple of years now (maybe 3 or 4?). I absolutely LOVE this pill for controlling my acne. It is the only other thing besides daily antibiotics (doxycycline) that have controlled my acne. I tried Sprintec prior to this and it did nothing for my acne. Short term, I have had no side effects from Loryna. No weight gain, no extreme mood swings, nothing. My only complaint and reason for considering switching is that after taking this long term, I recently developed spider veins on my thighs. I have NEVER had such a thing so it was very concerning as I am only 25 and in very good health, and as I know there are increased risks for DVT while taking this drug. Recently the areas on my thigh where the spider veins developed have become somewhat painful at work (as I stand all day). I attribute the development of the spider veins directly to Loryna as this is only medication I have taken the past couple years. It is such a shame because I absolutely love what it has done for my skin (flawless even during the time around my period), but the veins cause a large concern for me so I am heavily considering switching. 
Overall, I love Loryna for the shorter term, however if you plan to be on it for a few years, it may be concerning.

After a lifetime of heavy and irregular periods I actually stopped having periods.  After 5 yrs I had it replaced.  My new Dr. did the removal and insertion of the new Mirena under general anesthesia.   For the first year all was great. Then the unexplained spotting began..I was told it was stress... then bleeding and cramping for months that finally ended with bright red blood loss during sex... scared the heck out of my boyfriend and me... again dr told me stress was to blame.  I changed Drs and was informed that hormone changes which cause the bleeding during sex.  I am having it removed.   Too much at risk the 2nd time around.,7,08-Oct-12
MD-50114,420,I have used Soma (carisoprodol) for 6 years and it is definitely great help for my fibromyalgia muscle spasm pain.

Now for about 10 years I&#039;ve been on the Gabapentin as part of my medical cocktail. We just had to increase the dosage today from 600 to 900 as the clusters were back on a nightly alarm clock basis. Well, tonight I have been headache free and hoping this increase will do the trick. Has worked before but maybe just time for increase in my dosage. Prayers please. These clusters are no fun. Thanks and good luck to all headache patients.",10,01-Sep-15

I&#039;m glad it has worked so well for others, but for me it was like a very bad trip. I was literally bouncing from wall to wall, couldn&#039;t walk or see clearly, even hallucinating. I had a severe reaction to it, but I am extremely sensitive to tricyclics and all SSRI&#039;s except Remeron.

MD-50120,83,I have had random panic attacks and anxiety since I was 21 years old. I had a bunch of problems and couldn&#039;t figure it out. Randomly one day I looked up anxiety. I was put on Venlafaxine which is Effexor. I would recommend Effexor or Venlafaxine for people who have anxiety. Yes every medicine has its downsides but there are more upside to this medicine then there are down to me. But one thing I will agree with everybody else is that the withdrawals are completely hell compared to anything that you have ever seen. But on the upside it help for the lot of problems that come with anxiety. Also it is hard to sleep on but that&#039;s fine I would rather not be able to sleep so well then be freaking out all the time.,8,08-Sep-16

What it does work very well for is pain from my chronic kidney stones (I have permission from my doc to use it for the stones).

My chest cleared up by the first month. The results are AMAZING and I finally feel like I&#039;m thriving rather than hiding behind thick coats of makeup and high cut shirts. So, its a really complicated process to even start the whole accutane journey. You have to get your blood drawn once a month and women HAVE to be on birth control.

MD-50252,236,"Plan B is a life saver! My boyfriend and I had sex for the first time during my most fertile days while I was ovulating.  He finished inside of me and the very next day we bought Plan B one step.  I took it around 10 hours after the incident.  I was worried non stop and reading these reviews night and day.  Around two days later I experienced a yeast infection, which was mild, and cleaned up on its own a few days later, but I was freaking out.  After research, I learned that Plan B can restart your cycle, causing the pH balance to be thrown off in the process, causing the yeast infection. I experienced a lot of mood swings over the few weeks, however my boyfriend was always extremely supportive and reminded me it would be alright and we had nothing to worry about.  If it wasn&rsquo;t for him, I would have drove myself bananas for those few weeks.  I definitely recommend having your partner being a strong support system; it will make the process so much better when you know you&rsquo;re not alone in this.   I ended up getting my period two days ahead of time and the only negative side effect from plan B was heavy cramps I haven&rsquo;t experienced before.  I am now on birth control and look forward to never having to go through that again.  Relax, ladies!  It will work! (On a side note, I wasn&rsquo;t aware the Plan B apparently had a weight limit until after I took the pill. There&rsquo;s a myth that states it only works if you&rsquo;re under 165 and will not work if you&rsquo;re over 175.  The fact of the matter is, when testing plan b, the group of tested women were all around the same weight, and there was no group of women that was tested that weighed over 175.  So it is not so much as &ldquo;It will not work&rdquo;, but more of &ldquo;we haven&rsquo;t tested that far&rdquo;  I am 5&rsquo;8, and over that weight limit.

I&#039;ve had a touch of insomnia and some weird dreams and the weird feeling in my head kind of makes me want to give up but I hopped on the scale before I started typing this and I&#039;ve also lost 4 lbs so far (I&#039;m 41 years old, 5&#039;4&quot; and started at 206) I&#039;m going to call my doc tomorrow to be on the safe side.

At that time the doctor would simply prescribe pain killers for treatment, but they did nothing. They only helped me sleep for a few hours and then I would wake back up to the headache again.  After seeing a neurologist I was prescribed Imitrex. I have tried all three forms of the medication, the pills did not work as well for me because I always vomit with a migraine.  I simply did not get enough doses with the injections to last a month, only two in a prescription.  But with the nasal sprays, I receive 6 each month and they work GREAT.",10,"April 8, 2009"

I had been diagnosed with adhd and bipolar disorder (even though I never had a manic episode). I had tried other medications. After a suicide attempt, I tried zoloft, however, there was no effect. After this ssri, I tried other medications and everything made me unbelievably worse. After trying medications like lithium, lamictal, depakote, and abilify; I finally was put on 10 mg prozac and then 20 mg. This was it. I felt an instant recovery after 3 weeks, where my mind finally woke up. I felt a part of my brain, which was not working, was now working. It was lifesaving.",10,"April 10, 2016"
MD-50286,121,Yes it is great at preventing pregnancy because you loose your entire sex drive. I&#039;ve had mine in for a year now and I&#039;ve seriously only had sex with my husband twice and I basically made myself because I felt so bad for my husband. Bleeding was non-stop which I was told would be..got on the pill to control bleeding because I passed out at work and was alone..not sure how long I was out for before a guard found me. Mood swings are insane crazy. Either I&#039;m a zomby or I&#039;m completely pissed at everything. I would NOT recommend Nexplanon to anyone.

I took nexplanon for a year and a half. I had some weight gain and no sex drive because I was constantly on my period. I just feel as if there are more negatives than positives with nexplanon.

Over the last year at work, I noticed that I had begun to have more regular emotional meltdowns and panic attacks. It was at that point that I decided I had to find a solution. I had already gone through counselling with various people and decided to try medication. Started at a low dose of 50mg per day. At the very beginning it made me a bit tired and nauseous, but it&#039;s been a while and I&#039;m at 100mg. I think the 50 was pretty good, but at 100 I feel like I&#039;m living on autopilot and am emotionless toward many things. I&#039;m going back to 50mg and think I&#039;ll only go up to 100mg when I really need it. TBH though, I would rather be numb than go through the depression from before.",8,07-Feb-17

I have a false advertising complaint against Estring. Their Coupon says in large letters, &quot;Pay no more than $15 for your ESTRING prescription.&quot;  The very fine print says. &quot;savings are limited to $100 for each of 4 uses,&quot; meaning you only save $100 for each Rx, but this Rx is VERY expensive, so no one pays $15, but usually much more.

Depending on your cervix size,  you may have one mild cramp or several as they stretch the opening. My cervix was measured and scoped with a camera for depth of where the Kyleena should be placed properly.  Then comes the fun part.

I went to see my Doctor and after a few tesst it was positive. Plan B didn&#039;t work for me not even after drinking it just 1 hour after unprotected sex.,1,24-Jun-15

MD-50510,460,"I&#039;d suffered from toe nail fungus for over ten years. I&#039;d tried every possible topical treatment but nothing worked. All ten of my nails were infected. I also had VERY dry rough skin on my feet. Doctors just told me this was dry skin and couldn&#039;t be treated. I researched Lamisil for my nail fungus but the side effects scared me. Eventually my feet were affecting my life so I decided I had to try it.
It&#039;s AMAZING! I literally saw results within 2 weeks. In the past I&#039;d trim and file my nails to remove the fungus and after that they&#039;d look slightly better but within days the fungus would reappear. Not any more!

I would get maybe a week or 10 days between extremely heavy periods. The most frustrating part was that I called my doctor&#039;s office several times, only to be told that while my experience wasn&#039;t typical, I had to give it more time. I wanted to have it taken out, but kept hoping that things might get better. I still have it in.

I&#039;ve tried several types of skincare to control the breakouts to no avail.

MD-50675,362,"If you&#039;re taking samples currently, please read this. I have to love and hate this medicine.
Pros
It does what it says it does. It makes you go!
It doesn&#039;t give you full on diarrhea if you take it every few days. Just soft stools which is a great thing!
Cons
You cannot take this medication everyday no matter what the doctor tells you. Maybe it&#039;s my body or something but I can promise you, your body will soon reject the medication if taken everyday for more than 5 days. 
If continued in such a fashion, you will bloat, cramp and become MORE constipated than before. It will plug you up FOR REAL. It&#039;s not strong enough to make you go a lot the next day if you need it.Take a weak laxative with it. 
Still the best IBS/Constipation meds I&#039;ve found.",6,19-Feb-16
MD-50676,691,"I have been taking these pills on and off since last year.  When I am strict with my diet I see amazing results.  My body has adapted to them, so that is my only downfall.  They are no as affective as when I 1st started them.

To anyone having side effects, I was having terrible headaches and dry mouth.  My doctor offers name brand and generic pills.  The generic pills give me massive side effects, I can only take name brand. If you are having side effects take 1/2 pill in the am and the other 1/2 pill late morning.  That way you can split the dose, it will stay in your system longer and may help with evening crashes.",9,28-Feb-17

Either the side effects were too bad or it turned me into a complete zombie to the point work was out of the question, and then my dr said we would try one more called Prozac and the reason he had not prescribed it before was because it took 6-8 weeks to reach full effect as where the others took less then half that time. I started out taking 10mg because I have always been very sensitive to antidepressants and their side effects. For about the first 2 or 3 weeks I experience light anxiety... Then finally the 6 weeks passed and still nothing, but then finally about 8 weeks into the mediation, I feel like Santa Clause on steroids! It has saved my life! ",10,18-Nov-14

Dr said to either try invokana or insulin shots multiple times a day. Gave it a try- the most horrible yeast infections ever but lost 6lbs in 10 days - decided to stick with it and now almost a year later lost 35 lbs and feel great and a1c is down to 6 and I dropped my insulin down to 25 units!

Then the EXTREMELY tender breasts came, nausea and bloating a week before my expected period. My vagina was also very dry throughout the two weeks likely due to the high hormone dosage.

I can honestly say I didn&#039;t really feel a thing during the insertion. Maybe the ibprophin did help but still a lot easier then I thought it would be! 6 hours later and still no pain...light bleeding but I am at the end of my period so no biggie really. I am really hoping this works out for me as I am 33 and do not plan on having anymore children. I have typically never have side effect of any medication except the very minor things...so keeping my fingers crossed. I would definitely suggest getting this done if you just don&#039;t feel like being on the pill anymore!!,8,21-Oct-15

Another commenter is right, if you take it more than 1/2 hour before eating (I wake up and take it in the wee hours of the morning or as soon as I wake up.)

I travel a lot and even so much as got samples from my dermatologist since I don&#039;t check my bags and because of the airline restrictions. I haven&#039;t had any bad reactions and noticed just after a few days of using it a huge difference in my skin.

MD-50850,121,"I&#039;ve recently come off yasmin due to reading about the increased risk of blood clots. However I was on it for a number of years and had an OK experience with it. 

The positives were I had no headaches (I had excruciating migraines with marvelon) and my skin was perfect - only the occasional spot before my period similar to what it was like on diannette. 

However the bad side effects for me were weight gain, I put on roughly half a stone which no matter what I couldn&#039;t shift and I was tired all the time. I also had zero sex drive.

I&#039;d recommend trying yasmin if you&#039;re concerned about acne and particularly if you&#039;re looking to come off diannette. However as I say it&#039;s not perfect and everyone reacts differently.",7,"April 18, 2017"

Overall it has been helpful with managing my ADHD symptoms, I&#039;m much less distracted and able to stick to one task at a time. It was especially helpful when I was in school because it was just so impossible for me to stay focused in class. As an adult it makes work so much easier for me because my job requires things to be done with a lot of precision. Side effects I&#039;ve experienced have been headaches (occasionally migraines), inconsistent appetite, restlessness at night, some difficulty sleeping and constant thirst.

One of the main side effects of SSRI&#039;s is sexual dysfunction; however, I personally haven&#039;t seen much of a difference regarding this common side effect, apart from lasting longer in bed (which is great for her).

Only the phenothalien/old Ex-lax formula laxatives and Zelnorm were of use.  Phenothalien also required drinking 8-16 ounces more fluid when you were already congested, adding painfully to existing distension and then needing to wait up to hours.  Since that laxative was removed from the US market in the 2000&#039;s, availability now is very limited; Zelnorm was recalled by the FDA for strokes and cardiac issues (and did cause punch-in-the-gut cramping.)

MD-50868,667,"After 2 months on the generic form of this pill, my doctor suggested I move to Loestrin. It seemed pretty awesome because for the 3 months I was on it, I had no periods or cramps. I did experience weight gain, breast tenderness, major mood swings, loss of libido and slight increase in acne. Personally, I loved not having periods. It was cool and it saved me money on tampons. But the lack of sex drive was enough to convince me and my doctor that this wasn&#039;t the birth control for me. I&#039;ve switched to Ortho Tri-cyclen and lost the 7 pounds I had gained in the 3 months I was on Loestrin.

When he was finally done I went pale and felt like I was going to pass out, doubled over with the worst abdominal pain ever. He got me ibuprofen but that did nothing.

However, it controls my symptoms so well that I won&#039;t stop taking it.  It is the only medication in its class that works for me.

Lastly, it does work well for depression and anxiety. The downside is that it will dull cognition greatly and can also greatly increase depression at certain doses.

It had reached a stage where my psychiatrist was discussing adding another drug to the mix to make the Venlafaxine work better. Before I could start the other drug as well, I fell pregnant and went cold turkey. I was persuaded to go back onto Venlafaxine and 8 months later I&#039;ve shot up from the lowest to the highest dosage. It&#039;s not a case of becoming immune to the drug. For those who experienced great results that tethered out, you&#039;re not crazy. Venlafaxine has a tendency to plateau. It&#039;s not you, it&#039;s the drug.",3,01-Dec-15

I was so anxious that I stopped eating and sleeping. During those past two months I was feeling very anxious in the mornings and afternoons and some times back to my normal self at night. I developed a social phobia as well. 
Paxil has terrible side effects, nausea, insomnia, total loss of appetite ( didn&#039;t have much to start with) drowsiness, involuntary muscle movements...... etc. I thought about stopping it the third day because of insomnia.

MD-50965,121,"So I got Nexplanon just under a year ago. I originally got it because it was supposed to stop my period (and mine is generally on the irregular side) and because it was free with my student insurance and lasted 3 years. So my first ~2 months were terrible. I bled every day and it ranged from a regular period flow to spotting that was on the heavy side. Then for the next 6 months it was regular period timings, but they would often last longer than my previous periods had. 7-9 days instead of my usual 4-6. Now, in the last 3 months it seems to have tailed off and my period has stopped, as the product promised it would.

I could not be happier! The nausea was better the first day after taking it, and within two or three days was totally gone. I finally have my appetite back, too.

I was prescribed Atralin at night and Acanya in the morning. My skin started clearing up in about a month and within two months it was about 50% better. After about 3-4 months on the product my skin made a complete turn around and my marks are faded. Thank God for this skin care regime.

I hit my threshold of not &quot;feeling&quot; this month and am most likely getting an IUD next month. I am a very emotional person, which I love that about myself. On Junel, I am numb and just blah.

However, after two months I began to notice myself having mood swings.  This was so strange for me because I am such a relaxed, chill person.  I couldn&#039;t ignore that I was moody.  Little irrelevant things that happened with my boyfriend would make me very sad/mad and well. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever cried as much as I did when I was on this.

Quite depressing since it was my first time taking contraception. I had all the possible side effect to be honest. Hot flashes at night, terrible migraines, severe back ache, fatigue, tiredness name it. There was a point i went to doctors everyday but now I got used to feeling ill which is quite sad.

All three had horrible side effects and I finally found a doctor who would prescribe me the generic of Serzone again.  This medication keeps me on an even keel, keeps the anxious thoughts from overwhelming me and helps me sleep at night.

The two drugs that I was on had paradoxical effects and I exhibited really self-destructive behavior that I never had before.  I re-created trauma from my childhood and did other things that are now inexplicable.  That time of my life has become a complete and utter nightmare, and I don&#039;t even recognize that person that existed while on Lamictal/Lamotrigine and Prozac.

I didn&#039;t know I was ADHD until too late and severe damage had already been done to my life.  ADHD/Bipolar are often confused for each other, but the catch is that people with ADHD often have paradoxical reactions to psychotropic drugs. Be careful.",1,03-Dec-09

I am now a solid 125lbs, sometimes more. I have not changed my fairly healthy diet and do lightly excercise. My skin has not cleared up and my sex drive is gone.

I took the Milk of Magnesia at 8:00 am (I work from home) and thought that by the time my husband was home from work all the effects would be over. I took 5 tsps (as I know from past experience most laxatives I need higher dosage for relief), and by 5:30pm when my husband was home still nothing. It wasn&#039;t until 10:00 pm that I was able to relieve myself. A full 14 hours later. I was very happy that I had no cramping, and a very easy Bowel Motion, but had I been away from my home I would&#039;ve been much more upset with the time line.

Number one you must have been pregnant  already ITS NOT AN ABORTION PILL..if the  egg and sperm has met and attached to the wall you are pregnant that&#039;s why it&#039;s important to know if you had sex once and taking the pill thereafter.

I spotted for about two -three days but after that I was fine. I took birth control pills for years and after having the paraguard for six years I will never go back to the pills.  I have normal menstrual cycle..it isn&#039;t too heavy..and I don&#039;t cramp every month; however some months I do.

I was fainting without warning because of this drug. It ruined my life and I have not touched zyprexa in almost 2 years! It is a drug so terrible it should not be prescribed to anybody. The makers of this drug should be totally ashamed of themselves. They really should be punished for what they have done and continue doing to peoples lives with this drug. No joke.,1,15-Sep-17

I had no negative side effects. No withdrawal on reducing dosage. I don&#039;t suffer undue hunger - actually for me my depression contributed to a lack of appetite so any effect was actually beneficial to me. For me it worked wonders and enabled me to work.

I think with all these drugs there are different effects on different people and each person is also suffering a unique conditions. I was lucky in that my doctor hit on the right combination for me day 1",10,19-May-15

Perhaps those people&#039;s infection had a greater impact on their bodies so the curing cream burned because the cream began to fight the infection. Regardless the product works great.

I have recently started taking Topamax to offset this, so hopefully this will help. But it does help immensely with problematic thoughts and I notice a huge difference in my state of mind and overall well being when I take Risperdal.

MD-51359,200,"I have suffered with moderate to severe depression my entire life.  Last August, after 9 years on Effexor, I stopped taking it because of the side effects.  

I tried using supplements as recommended by  Julia Ross in her book The Mood Cure, but they were not effective for me.  My depression became so severe last Oct. that I had to go back on to an anti-depressant (Bupropion) but this medication made my depression much worse.  I was then put onto Trintellix in April.  The Trintellix was helpful, but side effects soon began to appear.  

I happened upon an article about a psychiatrist who had used niacin for treating depression.   When I googled niacin and depression, I came upon many other blogs and comments from other people who also found niacin to be effective against their struggles with depression. 

 I was desperate to find an alternative to taking anti-depressants, so 4 weeks ago, I began supplementing with niacin plus vitamin C.   (I had already been taking a vitamin B multi, magnesium, fish oil and Vit. D).  I started with 100mcg niacin and have been gradually increasing the dose by 25mcg increments each day.  I use only the regular niacin, not the timed release nor the non-flushing type.

Since I started taking the additional niacin &amp; vitamin C,  I find that my depression is/has diminished significantly.  I am no longer suffering from that bottomless well of depressive  feelings that had been with me since last fall.  I stopped taking the Trintellix  3 weeks ago and my depression has continued to lift.",10,19-Jun-15

I was diagnosed schizophrenic but for the most part it was the anxiety controlling my life, never the hallucinations. Every medication on the market besides two or three cause an enormous amount of weight gain and intolerable side effects with no legal recourse if encountered. The pharmaceutical industry has hired many attorneys and lobbyists to destroy all liability in the event of a potential hazardous or death inducing side effect for the most part.

I had issues with a lot of things and getting mad and wanting to argue all the time and just could not deal with feeling that way and I have always had great out look on life even if life was horrific. Since I have been on this medicine it has helped, yes the medicine wants you to sleep more and sometimes you feel groggy but I notice if I start taking it in the evening and close to bedtime it works best. Just don&#039;t take it when you get up or in the afternoon because it will make you drowsy.

MD-51417,482,I have been on Methadone for almost a year now since coming off Oxycodone. It stopped working and the dose could not be raised without hurting my liver because of all the Tylenol in it. I love this medicine and how it is long acting so there are no waiting periods for the pain to subside. I have Chronic pain from Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. My doctor mentioned Methadone I was a bit miffed as it is usually for Heroin addicts. He said it could be taken long term with the least damage to my body which is good because there is no current cure for my illnesses.

I&#039;ve always been active, exercising 6 days a week and I ate well. The medicine turned off any cravings I had and I felt full after only a few bites of the healthy food I was eating. There were two big down sides.  First, the cost!  It went from $150 to $190 in the 7 months I took it. To add to it, my state requires monthly check ins at the Dr. which add $60 a month for a total of $250/month.  If I was continuing to drop a lot of weight, it might have been worth it but I plateaued and for the last 3 months did not lose any weight.  Been off for 3 months and I have maintained.

This combined with cognitive therapy has got me back on track.  I really didn&#039;t experience any side effects except feeling crappy when I first got on it.  Within 4 weeks it was fine.

It honestly saved my life.It is so hard to survive this illness when you cant get in under control. I had forgetten what it was like to be myself. I was angry and pissed off at everyone.

I did get the headaches but don&#039;t know if it was from lack of eating and lack of coffee. I did notice that my tastebuds were affected, which had never happened in the past, so I figured it would go away, it has now been 16 days since I started the medication and my test buds are getting better but things still taste like chalk, I&#039;ll wait for a couple of weeks see if taste buds get better but for now I eat enough not to be hungry.",9,31-Mar-17

Didn&#039;t notice much of a difference initially but by the time I was up to 1mg 3 times a day my life so greatly improved.  I currently take another medication (Xanax).  I was taken off the medication because I became an alcoholic. When I detoxed from alcohol I was immediately taken of Klonopin. My only concern for people that are taking it is that if they decide to stop, please withdraw from it properly by a gradual reduction over a period of time.

Dr. gave me a sample of Estrace Vaginal cream. I admit I was afraid to use it and had little faith that it would help so I used only a pearl size amount on clean dry skin every night for 2 weeks. That ammt. Is sufficient to cover all the external parts and more, it emulsifies.
I am COMPLETELY healed as far as pain with intercourse and also pain upon urination. It was a MIRACLE for me.
Side note: If you stop using it (3X a week after the initial 2wk nightly use) you&#039;ll be back at square 1.  I give Estrace  a 10+ rating C:

I suffer from fibromyalgia, degenerative disc disease, sciatica, myofacial pain with trigger points...I think you get my drift. 

This has been the only muscle relaxer I have not become immune to and that works for me well. I generally have major side effects from medication, but I do not feel anything has been noteworthy with this muscle relaxer.

My suggestion would be talk to your doctor, give it a try. ANY medication can have adverse effects or not work for you. Each person is different. If people are taking other medication in conjunction to this then it may effect them differently.",9,28-Feb-17

Nucynta to the rescue! I started on 4x50mg/day, which was increased to 6 per day. After I was stable on that, I was switched to 2x100mg Nucynta ER per day, with 2x50mg Nucynta immediate release for breakthrough pain.

I switched immediately and some of the symptoms are withdrawal from the Cymbalta.  The &quot; reverberations&quot; in my head are distinctly withdrawal symptoms.  My headaches appear to be from decreased sodium which is a Brintellix side effect and for me are eliminated by drinking Gatorade which is high in sodium.

It&#039;s really that powerful.

Sadly, the side-effects are quite unpleasant, but an indicator that they are really working.  Fatigue, mild nausea, and lower abdominal issues seem to be quite common, and all three have hit me.  It&#039;s unpleasant to the point that I&#039;ve more than once thought of stopping the treatment, but I know that&#039;s a bad idea.

I got a breakout a few days ago and treated it with a Valtrex 1 day cycle.  Today I broke out with another cold sore even though I just took the medicine.  This has happened before too.  I will do another cycle but I don&#039;t know if it will help.  I will say that the sores are smaller when I take Valtrex but still last about 7 days.

I hate not knowing if I will have a period or not . my mentality changed as well; usually I&#039;m a very happy girl, but the pill made me  into a raging mean lunatic. It gave me extreme mood swings, frequent migraines, problems with my vision, depression, hair loss, extreme bloating, no sex drive at all, vaginal dryness,  increased acne on my chin , numbness in my feet,  and lack of sleep.

I also had constipation pretty bad the first month but that symptom went away too. My husband noticed a change in me first.  The side effects eventually went away. I upped my prescription from 30mg to 60mg after one month. Some side effects came back but again they eventually went away.

I stayed up and I was seeing and hearing things that weren&#039;t there, I couldn&#039;t do simple tasks,  I forgot where my room was after my boyfriend told me to drink some water, I cried over everything, I was scared of everything.

Seriously, I&#039;m afraid that it&#039;s doing more harm then good to her body.

I lost my appetite, had upset stomach and it messed up my sleep. Once my body adjusted (about 2 weeks) I had more energy, was more engaging with my friends and family and the physical symptoms subsided. After about 3 months I moved and lost my medicines and stopped abruptly. The depression and anxiety came back tenfold because I didn&#039;t wean myself off. I felt overwhelmed with life.

My throat became scratchy and I felt horrible.  I believe that the medicine is causing post nasal drip which in turn is making my throat hurt.

However, I have noticed that the first few days of a new pack, I get vaginal itchiness and I worry that I&#039;m going to get a yeast infection.
This second month has been terrible, though. I started my second week of pills with some light spotting, and now I am at the end of my 3rd week and it has progressively turned into a fairly regular flow, so much so that I have to wear a tampon every day.

I dropped 2 more pounds today from mowing the lawn and walking the treadmill for thirty minutes. I do have to make myself eat I&#039;m never hungry. I eat 6 times per day counting in at about 2000 calories a day. I watch my carb and sugar intake, but eat lots of dietary fiber and protein.

Before using the product I did a home swab test and it was candida, not bacterial. Always test before using this product.  Yes, after a few hours there is some burning and itching, but I bought the pack with wipes and cream included, definitely helps.  The level of pain you might feel is relative.  I do not find it any more painful than the hell I went through with the UTI.  In fact, it is tolerable. Use 3 or 7 day if the side effects will be a problem",8,21-Feb-16

I called my doctor to make sure this was normal and she said you can have irregular bleeding for up to four months after getting the IUD due to your body getting used to the hormones.  Besides that everything else has been normal. It&#039;s seem to have helped my acne and I have noticed I&#039;m not as emotional as I&#039;ve been on other types of birth controls.

When I use it, I get muscle pain, back pain, anxiety, and agitation.

There must be a gentler, kinder, and safer antibiotic to be used to kill bacteria. I wish I knew the name of one. I would, then, ask my doctor or an ER doctor to prescribe it for me.

I am tired of doctors telling me it is the best antibiotic to use for an U.T.I. It makes me sick! ",4,10-Feb-17

Bloated, constipated, angry, vivid, nasty dreams, no sleep, lethargic and so so emotional I burst into tears over nothing.  In the end I cut back to half the usual full dose and eventually stopped taking Champix altogether after 6 weeks.  Took some time after this for the symptoms listed above to disappear completely but eventually they did. ",9,04-Jul-14

MD-52102,318,So in high school over ten years ago I started to sweat really bad under my arms. It was super embarrassing to go through high school with this issue. After trying over the counter products and home remedies I gave up. So my Dr at the time recommended Drysol. I used it for just a few weeks and it worked so good. But then after a few months I noticed my armpits darkening. So I stopped using it. Now about 15 yrs later I&#039;ve tried so many things to lighten my armpits and nothing works. This stuff did 100% cure my sweaty armpits and I can now freely wear shirts without the sweat marks. But it burned me so bad that I have dark scars for life and still can&#039;t walk around freely with tank tops. I guess you can&#039;t win them all.,7,05-Nov-15

First of all I had very little relief from my symptoms due to the genetic bullseye (it&#039;s approx 2 inches round) falling off! The adhesion is subpar therefore I was not receiving adequate efficacy from this product. I used tegaderm and even waterproof medical tape to keep the patches on but doing so caused skin tears and irritation. I just started the new Brand this week and I am hoping for better results.

MD-52161,121,My review is only over the insertion. It would&#039;ve been pretty quick and easy if I wasn&#039;t one of the 2% that have a moving uterus. My GYN had to clip my uterus down before insertion. The insertion was simple and quick. I didn&#039;t bleed at all which was fantastic. It was inserted on what was supposed to be my first day of my period but I didn&#039;t come on my period until the next day. It is still the same old light period. Now the cramping afterwards was there but not too terrible and I think it was there because my uterus went through 25mins of trauma.

I started a month at 25mg, a month at 40mg, and about 2 weeks at 80mg. Wow, have things really taken off for me! I am getting so much done at home and am motivated to get a job again! The one downside is the cost. Seriously? My insurance won&#039;t cover it so my 80mg prescription was almost $500! To combat nausea, take with food always!

It worked. No traditional opioid high or weird effects. Just pain relief. I have noticed a bit of a rash on my chest and arms, but it doesn&#039;t itch and isn&#039;t raised.

The flow is normal but with more cramping than usual. Overall, I am very pleased with this product! It is way less expensive than a baby, and I am never having sex without protection again!

I have a headache every single day.. Constant dizziness and fatigue. I&#039;m a personal trainer so it&#039;s my lifestyle to eat right and train almost everyday. I noticed I&#039;m not losing any fat, instead I gained about 3lbs and constantly feel like I&#039;m retaining water. As I type this I have a throbbing headache on the left side of my head.

I also feel better I don&#039;t hear voices anymore and I felt good enough to cut and color my hair. 2 weeks ago that would&#039;ve been out if the question.

Low carbohydrates and fat diet in general, plenty of veggies and lean meat or eggs. 30 mins of aerobic exercise a day. Like someone said, it&#039;s will power in a pill. The only side effect was a headache the first two days and Advil took care of it. I&#039;m naturally a relaxed and happy person, but I do feel a general wellbeing and sleep better.

Lysteda started working within a half hour of taking first dose.  My flow was reduced by at least 60%. A couple of ibuprofen for light cramps and life was business as usual.

I thought at first it was useless, I was wired and wide awake, but by the third to fourth day, I noticed I was dreaming again, which I had rarely done in 9 months.

The drug has been amazing at reducing my anxiety and completely removing depression. Side effects in the first few weeks were rather unpleasant. I came up with a way of eliminating them by increasing the dosage gradually 2.5mg every week eventually stopping at 15mg. This gradual approach allows your brain chemistry to adjust more naturally I&#039;d recommend it. Before I started my depression was so bad I was suicidal and had no interest in anything.

My only regret is that I didn&#039;t start this medication sooner! By the end of the 1st night, my pain went from an agonizing 9 down to a manageable 3-4. By the time I had finished, my pain is down to a 1-2 and my toes are getting the feeling back in them. The only side effects I did get was upset stomach, painful bloating and gas, and insomnia for a couple nights. I&#039;ve only been off the medication for 3 days and feel great!",9,04-Sep-14

A nurse stood next to me and chatted with me throughout the proceedure, and they gave me a heating pad. It was 30 seconds tops of pain which I could easily breath through.

MD-52383,200,"&bull;	19 Apr. 2016

Began initial dose at 2230 hours. Felt the medicine working within a &frac12; hour. Was in a good mood as I had been taken off of Warfarin this date. Before drifting off to sleep, I glanced at the clock. It was approx. 2300 hrs. I had an odd feeling in my throat that was possibly closing up. I remember worrying what is going on here? As the feeling in my throat persisted, I also felt my &ldquo;Adam&rsquo;s apple&rdquo; fluttering and an elevated heart rate. I soon fell asleep. No other meds taken except for Atorvastatin.

&bull;	20 Apr. 2016  

I awoke a 0600 hours to go to the bathroom. Upon arising, I felt a damp spot at the back of my underwear. Pulled the sheets back a discovered I had Shit the bed in my sleep. Felt real dizzy and drowsy. Thought to myself &ldquo;how &amp; why?&rdquo; this happened. Went to shower.

As the morning continued on at 0630, the side effects were evident:
1.	&ldquo;Hot flashes&rdquo; Absolutely miserable. Could not get / stay comfortable. Firstly, had the flushing sweats, then I would get too cold. Turning off the air conditioner and fan for about a half an hour, Becoming hot again. This has continued on and has not stopped. Extremely bad migraines as well since waking and did not let up at all. Sensitive to noise, light and sounds.
2.	The same feeling in my throat upon waking, I drank water to cool off and see if this would stop. And it didn&rsquo;t.
3.	My face was tingling all over as well.
4.	Moderately nauseous upon standing up or sitting down. The nausea had continued all day. Had a special K cereal bar to ease this up in the morning. Having only relief from it less than an hour.
5.	Tried eat cereal for lunch and discovered unable to eat it at all. The taste of it was making me sicker.
6.	Took two 500 mg acetaminophen at 0700, relief was only slight and the head aches returned less than two hours.
7.	Overall neck pain eased up and other arthritic symptoms did as well. I could definitley tell a difference, However the head ache did not.


8.	Decided to take a dosage during the morning at 1000 hrs. To avoid loss of bowel control in my sleep. Within about two hours, felt it working through my system. Same effects I mentioned as before. Severe headaches and Nausea all day. And of course unbearable hot &amp; cold feelings again thinking that these should eventually pass as I become used to it.
9.	Laid down from 1400 to 1700 to alleviate the symptoms. Awoke from the nap and tried to eat dinner. One bite made me sick to my stomach. Headaches still there. 
10.	Overall, felt the same until bedtime as I did all day. Will give it one more try tomorrow morning.
Did not take any meds except Atorvastatin, and two acetaminophen.

&bull;	21 April 2016

Awoke at 0815.  No bowel leakage. Took another dose of Duloxetine at 1000. Was able to tolerate a cereal bar.

MD-52402,200,"Just over a month a go I went to see my GP after several weeks of battling my old foe the old black dog was not only back he was barking loudly.  

I was I admit surprised that my GP who I have only known for three years and who hasn&rsquo;t previously seen me depressed spotted my change in mood before I had had chance to tell him how I was feeling.  I walked out holding a script for a new drug Pristiq and began the medication the following day.  My next appointment to see how I was coping was for last Monday.  One of the side effects of Pristiq is according to the warning sheet my pharmacist gave me was hyper-wakefulness.  Needless to say I had a paradoxical effect I have spent a month falling a sleep during the day.  Later sleeping eight to ten hours at night.  Due to the most awful pharmaceutical hangovers I needed to get up at 6 am in order to be in a fit state to drive by 7.30. My doctor found this interesting but urged me to continue taking the drug as he felt sure it would help my illness saying I needed to be on it for twelve months.

However, in the past seven nights things have gone from bad to worse. Every night has been disturbed by the most frightful nightmares. Night sweats and terror on waking from the most vivid of horrors.  On Friday night I lay awake forcing myself to stay awake, I was far too frightened of returning into this new nightmare world to sleep.  My fearful dreams kept me from my bed the following night for several hours I finally went to bed in the early hours I slept fitfully my dreams were again frightening to say the very least luckily I can&rsquo;t recall them in detail by midmorning.  

It was on Saturday that I decided that enough is enough depression is more than sufficient without entering a nocturnal world of fear and torment.   While I was only on Pristiq for five weeks it was five weeks I&rsquo;m not about to forget any day soon.   

When the treatment is worse than the illness it is time to stop; take stock and in my case back away.   I know that I most probably should have spoken to my doctor but it was Easter and I couldn&rsquo;t see him so I made my own decision. Now only time will tell if my decision was the right one.     

But one thing I do know is as a drug Pristiq is not for me.  Even at its loudest a barking  black dog is less scary than a night on Pristiq.",1,28-Mar-16

At the nursing home, the physician switched me to Wellbutrin [less expensive] which was OK but not as good as Cymbalta.

MD-52529,621,"I had meningitis which was the result of an ongoing untreated and lingering sinus infection. I was on IV antibiotics along with oral Levaquin. A month later I took Levaquin for about 3 more weeks for extra measure to clear it all out. This med likely had a part in saving my life, because I&#039;m allergic to alot of other meds and I can tolerate this. The only thing I do/did notice when taking it, is vivid and sometimes intense/strange dreams. It stopped when I was done with the course. Had I taken antibiotics back when my sinus infection started (I didn&#039;t as I was scared of unneccessary meds) I wouldn&#039;t have gotten meningitis in the first place.

MD-52758,334,"First and foremost you nee to see a specialist.  Note that with the introduction of outside or additional testosterone your natural production can slow, and or shut down.  This is why you need HCG.  HCG keeps your natural testosterone in production even with the introduction of extra testosterone.  Also a good estrogen blocker pill is recommended to keep test from aromatizing into estrogen.  
To sum it up you need all of the following
1. Androgel
2. HCG- keeps natural testosterone producing, 
3. Anastrozole Pills-Stops Testosterone from being converted to Estrogen",5,17-Nov-10

I found myself 79 pounds in the hospital because I could not eat I could not sleep and I could not function, however misdiagnosed as an eating disorder and depression it took me quite a few times to even go to a doctor that noticed I may be a bit nervous. I bet that was an understatement. Because I keep getting slack about the medication I have tried kalanapin which brought me out like a teenager and did not work for me. I have tried valium which was way too strong for me. I have been on this medication for over 15 years and have never had to up my dosage not once and it still works. ",10,10-Nov-15

Then I was getting silvist injection I love that because I only get one injection.my insurance company refused to pay for it. they are ........!  I hope that one day they have to do this!. Sorry just my opinion. doctors need to take a stand against these evil cold insurance company who refused to treat the patent right instead of making them suffer .they aren&#039;t doctor&#039;s they know nothing about what I need .the people who run insurance companies have ice running thru their veins they are not human.",10,02-May-16

MD-52821,464,"I hope no one makes a desicion based on other peoples opinion.  I didnt at first like it becuz o fcouse 8/2 sounds like more than 4/2, so as an addict more is always better, But all of our bodys absorb meds diffrently, it can depende on alot of things. Subs do give u more energy and takes an hour to dissolve I wake up an hour before it is time to get up and put it in then go back to sleep for an hour so that  I&#039;m good to go when I wake up...smart huh",9,01-Oct-16

MD-52823,121,"I&#039;m 26, child-less, and cursed with painful, heavy periods. After trying pill after pill, I spent 4 years without birth control. Decided to try Skyla after an OB GYN and friend recommended it.  Not going to lie--- worst pain I&#039;ve ever felt having this thing put in! The 6 weeks following I bled almost everyday and had little random lightning-storms of bad cramps. After 3-4 months, my period are lighter and my PMS symptoms have improved. I still have bad cramps for a few days each month, but I&#039;m finally glad I got this IUD. Husband doesn&#039;t feel it, and it&#039;s nice not having to use condoms. On top of that, I think my appetite has decreased - not sure if it&#039;s related. 

In a nutshell, I recommend it. Just expect an adjustment period of time",7,25-Jan-16

Before taking this medication I lived a very active lifestyle and now I have no motivation to do anything. I don&#039;t even leave my house unless I have to.

It has helped with my depression  and anxiety, I used to spend countless hrs thinking n worrying about things beyond my control and it made me miserable.  My situation hasn&#039;t changed really, but I just don&#039;t end up doing all that endless thinking! Side effects have been drowsiness,  diarrhea,  excessive yawning,  and mild stomach discomfort.  All worth it, and the drowsiness wore off after taking it for a month or so. The excessive yawning went away after two months.

It started out to be right before my period, but now it is all the time. I never had these issues before taking Tri Previfem. It also makes me super hungry right before my period, where I want to eat everything in sight. But my major issue is definitely the depression, anger, anxiety and crying spells it has caused.

I haven&#039;t done the #2 in a few days and I have lower back abdominal pain and I feel bloated, so I figured it&#039;s the weekend and I have a few hours to spare before I go out (about 2hr) so I just canceled my plans.

Soma is the only  muscle relaxer that actually works.My new pain management Dr.does not like it &amp; wants me to discontinue using it. He is young, and at my age 68 ,I would prefer to live a better quality of life vs living longer and and suffering even more! I have read most of the studies, but these people do not live in severe pain and I have been in other rx stud studies,&amp; they are not convincing or long term, I think these are big pharma slanted!

My only complaints are my periods are A LOT heavier, and I tend to cramp when my cycle begins and during ovulation. I never had cramps prior to having the ParaGard inserted. These possible symptoms were relayed to me prior to placement so I was mentally prepared.
All in all, I&#039;m 3 years in, and I absolutely LOVE this thing. If my doctor still refuses to tie my tubes when I&#039;m older, I&#039;ll just have another inserted.",8,01-May-17

Coincidently, I have yet another appointment today. My body does not like this thing. When it was first placed inside, I experienced the worst pain I have ever felt in my life (no joke). If you want a pain rating, I&#039;d give it a 10/10. I still felt cramping a while after and the pain was so bad that they put me in a different room in order to sleep off the pain. Keep in mind I took pain relievers before the process as suggested. When I finally gathered enough strength to drive myself home, I continued to feel pain (8/10) for the next 3-4 days.

Now, I%u2019ve been taking phentermine pills for one month, one capsule between breakfast and lunch and the other in the afternoon, during the whole day I%u2019m not hungry and full of energy.

MD-52840,210,My experience after six weeks has been wonderful but scary at the same time. The drug makes me sick for a few days where I feel like I&#039;ve been put through a tunnel. After that it kind of reduces the rest of the week. It does make me feel light-headed but not overly dizzy. I will update later. So far so good.,10,13-Jan-17

I would get so moody, depressed and at times if something really gets to me I would really flip out. I really didn&#039;t pay it much attention until I started to get them more around the same time each month. Its not as bad as it was when I first started having problems with it.

Also keep a bland diet for the week of. I ate spicy noodles yesterday, and I wish I could have that decision back. 
All humor aside, I&#039;m really just hoping I don&#039;t have colon cancer. The prep is what it is, but you&#039;ll get through it. Drink the solution as cold as you can make it and do it fast. I chugged it and it wasn&#039;t that gross until the aftertaste. Sipping would be rough.",9,29-Jul-16

MD-52844,83,"During a recent stretch of terrible anxiety which  crept up very slowly, I suddenly became incapacitated. I was in fear of everything and I couldn&#039;t function- AT ALL. I went to my doctor and explained the symptoms and he recommended Lexapro 10 mg. with Klonopin .5 mg. as needed. I took both medications and the Klonopin erased all the startup side effects of the Lexapro such as increased nervousness, insomnia, and poor appetite. As soon as the Lexapro kicked in, ( about three weeks) I was able to step off the Klonopin and have felt great ever since. Anxiety has been wiped out and sleep has improved. I feel 100% better. Don&#039;t give up, this medication WORKS !!",10,19-Dec-14
MD-52845,674,Received one shot for three full months. Nearing the end . Major side effects were the hot flashes and some weird feeling of uneasiness. I would not take it again.

It was a little more expensive but well worth it.  It took me off caffeine without any headaches.  It gave me energy without any type of rush feeling.  I simply was able to do more longer without feeling tired or like I had caffeine in my system.  Within two weeks, people started commenting on my skin &amp; how good it looked.  There was such a noticeable difference. My hair started growing even faster.  I didn&#039;t know all these things would happen.  I ordered it for the energy benefits alone &amp; got so much more.

MD-52850,121,There are some bad reviews about Kyleena - so I wanted to share my experience. This IUD is for women that have not yet had children as the IUD is smaller than the Mirena. I expected pressure during the insertion process but I felt pain. On a scale from 1 to 10 it was a strong 6. I may have a high pain tolerance because my doctor laughed &amp; said when she got hers she started cursing at the ceiling. Right after I felt fine &amp; the nurse looked at me funnily. A couple of hours later I knew why. She expected me to have some severe cramping immediately after - but it took my uterus an hour to deliver those. They lasted through the night. It&rsquo;s been almost a week and everything is okay! Using condoms until my OB is sure the IUD is in the right place.,10,06-Dec-17

Now I have very few guilt feelings, nearly no depression, no suicidal thoughts, no obsessing over negative things. Not too much help with social anxiety, but does help anxiety around angry people.  Unfortunately, during PMS, it barely helps me, but once that is passed, I&#039;m okay again. Makes sleep WONDERFUL and easy.

I have had multiple endometrial biopsies that hurt a lot less. It was put in on 10/15/15 and I have not stopped bleeding since.

I still get up about 1x per night to urinate but the stream is reasonably strong and I can fully empty my bladder.  Missing a dose for 2 or 3 days results in noticeable degradation of initiation, stream flow and complete emptying of bladder.

Things finally evened out about 5 or 6 months and I&#039;ll either get a normal period or nothing at all. The only possible side effect now is it seems I get night sweats around the time I would be PMSing but I got those before this pill. So that could just be me.

But the benefits far outweigh the risk of not having it. I am able to eat and drink what I need to keep this baby growing and although I am still not able to return to work, I am able to do day to day tasks.

Only birth control I have ever used and I have no problems with it what so ever. No mood swings, no weight gain, no increased acne, and so light of periods that I only need a liner which lasts for 2 to 4 days. My sex drive is the same as it was before the pill and I haven&#039;t had a single pregnancy scare which is great because I&#039;ve had unprotected sex with my boyfriend the entire time I&#039;ve been on the pill. I of course take the pill like you are suppose to (every day at the same time) other than not bothering with the sugar pills. I recommend to try it for few months because when I first began the pill I had nausea but it stopped after few months",10,01-Mar-16

I would also self medicate with alcohol. At least once a week I would get to drunk I would black out. As you probably figured that caused a lot of problems in itself. I started taken Brentellix 6 moths ago and I have NEVER been so happy in my entire life! I love it! It really changed my life for the better. No more drinking! At all.

The pros for me are an increased sex drive (OMG.), I feel way happier, I have light periods, I haven&#039;t gained any weight, I don&#039;t have crazy acne, and I never notice it! I&#039;ve actually had 2 IUDS now in the last year because my other one kind of fell out and started to imbed in my uterine wall (which we didn&#039;t know until removal.

I was put on Cymbalta, but I enjoy a drink or 2 a day with my wife (Cymbalta and alcohol will destroy your liver- very well documented).  Zoloft made me feel completely despondent, and I felt life was no longer worth living, not to mention made me not even remotely think of sex.

I&#039;m a smoker so I frequently spread the cold sores around my mouth, just as one is healing another will show up. Two months of continuous cold sores hurts and is embarrassing. My friend told me about Valtrex a year ago after having cold sore after cold sore. After the first dose the sore shriveled up, second dose they were scabbed and healing.

Although I&#039;ve never really gained weight on Risperidone for 2 years was relatively weight neutral. I&#039;ve actually lost 5-10 lbs. since taking Latuda, pretty much without trying.

The one minor annoyance would have to be that it requires 350 calories for full absorption and it puts me to sleep about an hour after taking it. I end up eating a small meal/snack before bed every night (yogurt, nuts, etc.).",10,12-Jan-13

My mood swings have toned down so much I forgot what it was like to be this calm.

The only downfall is the stinging that occurs sometimes along with minimal peeling but other than that it gets the job done and I&#039;m pleased with what I&#039;m seeing thus far.

So far Concerta has made me feel productive and positive for about 3 hours, and then depression slowly creeps in and gets progressively worse for about 8 more hours.

Weeks two and three, I retained water; breasts felt pillowy; appetite went up; felt really tight and uncomfortable. But my period came right on schedule, without any cramps or heavy bleeding. Score!

I&#039;ve gained a few lbs, but it feels/looks like water weight only. I know this will improve as my body adjusts to the hormones, but right now it&#039;s pretty annoying. Otherwise I feel so much more like &quot;myself&quot; than I have in awhile, so I&#039;ll take it.",7,26-Dec-14
MD-53262,200,"I have been on 150mg for a little over a month, and I have lost a total of 16lbs already. Which I could use to loose some weight. But I do feel sometimes that I am very fatigued and my memory is lacking.",8,19-Nov-15
MD-53263,47,"I only had one shot in august 2016. I did not go back for my second shot I had a really bad experience on the depo, from hair fall, weight gain, depression to lower sex drive, all in the first 3 months of using this. Even though I didn&#039;t go back I&#039;m still bleeding everyday, it&#039;s not heavy bleeding but it still takes a lot of money out of your pocket to constantly buy buy pantyliners. This week I started to get this bubbly feeling in abdomen, lower back pain, gassiness, constipation.  So I&#039;m going to a doctor to get it checked out it. Could have turn into something much serious as I started to bleed more. I would not recommend this shot or even the implanon.",1,"April 10, 2017"
MD-53264,408,"Been taking it about once per month for about five years. Some months none, some months 2 or 3 pills. Pill probably works 3/4 times. It seems better than using tons of tylenol or ibuprofen which gave no relief and left me nauseous. 
Better treatment would likely be to alleviate a stressors and maybe even avoid sugar, or a cocktail of stress, sugar and fatigue all at once.",8,20-Jan-16
MD-53265,352,"I started this medication about 10 days ago.  Doxepin, 10mg, has been working more days than not.  Like most medicines, the first few days it worked like a charm.  I took it and I slept about 5.5 hours straight.  Sometimes can go back to sleep for another 1/2 an hour.  I do feel a little help in the anxiety category.  Not a lot but it does help a bit.  The bad thing about this medicine is that you feel very sedated throughout the day.  You know you slept because of the vivid dreams and you don&#039;t wake up the whole night.  Nevertheless, you feel extremely tired the whole day.  I wish I didn&#039;t have to take medicines.  But I rather be feeling sleepy and knowing that I slept as opposed to feeling sleepy due to no sleep.",7,10-Aug-14

55 now and never had so bad. See Dr next week.... RLS is worse then back pain

MD-53267,433,"I have a case of gastroparesis and it stopped me from going a lot of places and hanging out with my friends. It helps with the mild nausea really, really well, but when it gets severe, lets just say, its useless! That&#039;s the reason why I gave it an 8 because when its severe that&#039;s when I really need it.",8,18-Jun-13
MD-53268,482,"I LOVE Celebrex!  I have degenerative disk disease, bulged disk and degenerative hips.  My doctor had me try it after learning how I can tolerate 6 ibupropen a day.  I have been 85% better as far as the daily pain.  I can do things in exercise that I could not before, due to the pain.  I take homeopathic anti inflammatory supplements as well.  I am a 43 year old photographer, pilates student and teacher living in pain for over 6 years.  So wonderful to have this relief.",10,17-Feb-10
MD-53269,200,I was prescribed seroquel 100mg for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and I could only take it for two days.  I took it as prescribed before bedtime. I almost crashed my truck several times on my way to work and I had to pull over on the shoulder to sleep on my way home from work. Day 2 was a Saturday. I slept for 14.5 hours. I can&#039;t function at all on this.,6,28-Nov-14
MD-53270,84,"I used celexa to treat my severe stress triggered anxiety and panic attacks. It was limiting my life to the point I thought I&#039;d have to quit my job. I&#039;d never been on anti anxiety drugs but started on 10mg which is very low. Did not see effects immediately.  Things started feeling &#039;different&#039; before they felt better.  My personal side effects were fatigue, restless tossing and turning at night (normally I&#039;m out like a log), night sweats, and weirdly sweaty hands. All of this was WAY better than having anxiety though so I&#039;m not complaining!  It relieved some anxiety but didn&#039;t really pick up my mood. I&#039;m sensitive to medication and underweight so this might be a unusual experience. I&#039;m switching to Paxil to see if I get better results.",5,21-Jan-16
MD-53271,121,"I have been on Depo-Provera for 4 shots (1 year) and I have had relatively little side effects. Before Depo I was on regular Ortho-Tricyclen pills and Ortho Lo. On both previous methods I definitely gained weight (at least 5-10 pounds) and was moody with total lack of libido. I also got headaches a lot - not really bad ones but annoying enough. When I went back to get my prescription refilled, I told the doctor about the headaches and that one of my eyes was becoming slightly nearsighted. From these two factors, she recommended the shot rather than the pill. I had slight spotting, then periods were gone after 2nd shot, no headaches, small weight gain, and still less interested in sex than I would like to be but no birth control is perfect. Try it.",8,03-Aug-11
MD-53272,587,"I&#039;m been on Seroquel since been diagnosed (now 18 months). Started taking 50g but now I&#039;m on 100g. I&#039;ve got to the point on this medication that the side effects are too much. Constantly tired. Feel very vague. My memory is terrible. I&#039;m starting to forget about things I&#039;ve already done. Still very paranoid. Also I&#039;m still having panic attacks. So for me, it&#039;s time to move on and try something new (Olanzapine).",6,06-Dec-14
MD-53273,308,"I have been taking Metoprolol 25mg once a day for 13 days. It has lowered my heart rate by about 30 beats a minute but I am always tired, get chest pain, headache and numbness. Little to no benefit in lowering my blood pressure (140/95&#039;s).",6,"April 5, 2009"
MD-53274,83,"I was given this for GAD, 5mg twice daily.  It works great for anxiety and for sleep.  I&#039;m authorized 15mg daily but normally I take 10 as described above.  Before this I tried lie 20 different medications and they all gave me several side effects until the Doc gave me this one. Mild muscle relaxer which I also need, god for sleep and awake on day time when  need to be awake and alert.  Sure, if I lay back on day time after taking the pill I can easily take a nice nap. ;-)",10,13-Jan-16
MD-53275,482,"Took Tramadol for excruciating back pain. Worked marvelously for three weeks, pain 80% decreased, but affected my judgment as I saw events and people in an unrealistically positive way.  After 3 weeks, I started imagining blacks ghosts at night, got depressed and negative, my face felt like sunburned at night, nausea. Needless to say, I stopped taking the drug, withdrawal made the experience worse, I am back with pain waiting for surgery. BAD DRUG!",2,09-Sep-15
MD-53276,482,"This medication is supposed to be continual pain relief, but on day one it gives mediocre results, day two somewhat okay results although my pain is still at a 4. Then on day three, watch out. Pain level back to a level 8 to 10. I then go through the sweats on day three, and the chills and nausea the entire day. I have only been on this patch 1 month.",4,"April 24, 2009"
MD-53277,240,"The first 2 months I took this pill I wanted OFF and a new OB. I had horrible side effects from nausea to paranoid anxiety. 
I&#039;ve now been on it for 6 months and love it. I have no side effects, no periods (continuous use) and I have endometriosis and NO cramping! It&#039;s a literal miracle.
I have had a 10lb weight gain, but I have also recently been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and have stopped working out where as before I attended Zumba weekly to bi-weekly. I don&#039;t know what to attribute it to for sure but I would say maintaining your weigh would not be difficult even if it was the pill.
If you&#039;re googling because you were just put on it and are freaking out, I suggest pushing through. This has worked miracles for me!",10,02-Jan-16
MD-53278,84,"Hi, I&#039;m female from UK, age 16. I was on fluoxetine for a while and whilst at first it helped with my moods but after a few months I didn&#039;t really get much out of it, anxiety and depression wise. A few months ago I was switched to citalopram and I can say it has been an absolute lifesaver. I suffer from extreme sensitivity and most stressful situations get me extremely anxious . I&#039;m not having a good time with school ATM but I&#039;m generally feeling like I can cope with it, and that I don&#039;t spiral off into mania and anxiety anymore when something bad happens. I have minimal symptoms of anxiety anymore, with heart fluttering, tummy ache and shaking almost gone when I should feel anxious. My moods have improved greatly and I love this meds.",9,13-Mar-15
MD-53279,98,Vagifem greatly helps me with my atrophic vagnitis.  I was having extreme burning and pain.  I only wish I did not have to take this the rest of my life like my doctor advised me.  The mediciation sometimes gives me a slight headache.,10,20-Feb-12
